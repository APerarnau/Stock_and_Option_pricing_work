# Stock_and_Option_pricing_work

In this repository I will add files related to a project on Stock and Option pricing I am working on.
The idea is to make a 3D modeling system similar to the cool "optionsprofitcalculator.com" but I want to have more
control on the time variable, and learn a ton too.
